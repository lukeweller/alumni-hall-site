          <!--The Building-->
            <h2 class="sub-section-title">The Building</h2>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Alumni Hall was founded in 1931, next to the strikingly similar yet entirely distasteful Dillon 
              Hall. These two dorms were built during Knute Rockne's tenure as head coach, but completed only shortly after his death, and 
              in fact, relief sculptures of Rockne and his dog, Clashmore Mike are carved into Alumni's architecture. At the time, Clashmore 
              Mike was being used as a sideline mascot for the university football team, and the Alumni mascot of the "Dawg" was adopted in 
              memory of Knute Rockne, as Alumni took in the dog as their own after his passing.</p>
            <img src="images/about/hall.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid text-img">
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">During its construction, the gray stone and earth-tone brick used on the large dorms were the 
              first of their kind for ND, and so the two dorms received the nickname "The Platinum Coast", situated across South Quad 
              from the "Gold Coast", of Badin, Howard, and Walsh and Sorin. Alumni Hall was built in the style of French Collegiate 
              Gothic, a heavy, stone-based style that was fond of gargoyles (like the one in our tower) and ornamentation, a style now 
              reused and riffed on for many other buildings at Notre Dame, such as the new dorms, Dunne and Flaherty. Other figures on 
              our walls include St. Thomas Aquinas, Madonna and Child, and an unnamed student referred to as "Joe College", leaving his 
              studies for the real world, something that Alumni hopes to prepare its residents for, in ways far beyond simply academics.</p>
<!--Traditions-->
            <h2 class="sub-section-title">Traditions</h2>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">While there are no fraternities at Notre Dame, we don the greek letters Delta Omega Gamma 
              (DOG) during Welcome Week, Rivalry Week, Wake Week, and Senior Week. This lets every other dorm know we are there, with 
              bright green lights on South Quad, and to represent the true spirit of fraternity—brotherhood— that we share dearly with 
              fellow residents.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">In our 87 years, Alumni has amassed many traditions, and perhaps none as old as the hatred 
              for our brother dorm, Dillon. While the shenanigans hit their peak in the 70s and 80s with so-called 'Dillon Golf' and 
              shouting of "Dillon sucks!", the hatred between our two halls still hits its stride every year in October, during the 
              most storied and intense "Rivalry Week" on campus, including a variety of contests and our joint SYR (set-up your roommate) 
              dance.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">However, this is not the main event for Alumni--no, our favorite tradition comes in April, 
              during Wake Week. A week of celebration, whose events and origins remain shrouded in mystery to freshman until such a 
              time that they experience it firsthand, let it simply be said that nearly every Dawg, since its humble origins in 1983, 
              declares that the Wake is the best week of his life.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">But there are many other traditions and events, some more recent than others, that have 
              stood the test of time in our sacred hall. Our "five dollar formal" celebrates tomfoolery by asking residents to find 
              an outfit costing a sum total of 5 bucks, and wear it to a bowling alley for a night of good fun. Our rector Fr. George, 
              who has just celebrated his 40th year as our rector, will be turning 80 this January, and his birthday party formal is 
              among our other favorite nights in Alumni.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Some legends deserve to be passed down by word of mouth. Ask your RA about other Alumni 
              Hall traditions.</p>
            <!-- Wake Week Countdown-->
            <h2 class="sub-section-title" id="wake">Wake Week Countdown</h2>
            <p id="wake-count">Countdown to Wake Week</p>
            <!--FGR-->
            <h2 class="sub-section-title" id="fgr">FGR</h2>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                Fr. George Rozum, affectionately known as FGR, is much of the reason our tradition have persevered to this day; 
                the man means too much to express in such a short time, but rest assured you too will soon understand. That being 
                said, when you meet the man/legend on your first day, expect him to know your name, hometown, and major just from 
                your face. Perhaps most poignant thing to be said of the dorm are the words of our rector himself. And no, I don't 
                mean "highest recycling rates on campus", which may be true. No, rather "Notre Dame by choice, but Alumni by the 
                grace of God." <br><br>
                It is no small matter, walking into the main circle doors your first day, bags in hand, beneath a banner that reads 
                "center of the universe." Take that phrase tongue in cheek, or recognize its meaning. Not only are we perfectly 
                located on the Main Circle, near all academic buildings, a stone's throw from the dining hall, and a two-minute 
                walk to LaFun, but Alumni will be your home for the next four years. Strangers become neighbors, become friends, 
                become brothers.

            <h2 class="sub-section-title">Dorm Layout</h2>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The dorm has four floors. On the first floor there are rooms as well as our chapel, St. Charles Borromeo Chapel. The second and third floor are primarily dorm rooms along with a few study and common rooms. On the fourth floor there is a study lounge where Dawgs go to get some work done. </p>
